# 📝 Homework Assignment #1: Code Refactor

## Description
In this assignment I am given a completed webpage that is in need of refactoring to allow better accessibility, which in turn will allow the webpage to return higher in Google searches. This involves using semantic tags to better describe each section of the webpage, organizing the CSS in a way that resembles the structure of the HTML file, giving accessible alt attributes on icons and images, and making the overall code concise and descriptive.
